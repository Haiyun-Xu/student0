1. `gcc -m32 -S -o recurse.S recurse.c`
The instructions that cooresponds to "recur(i-1)" are:
	movl	8(%ebp), %eax
	subl	$1, %eax
	subl	$12, %esp
	pushl	%eax
	call	recur

2. The .text section contains the function machine code, and the .data section (probably contains the static data?)

3. `objdump --syms map.obj`

4. For a symbol, "g" means it is a global symbol and can be referenced by other object files, "O" means it is the name of an object, "F" means it is the name of a function, and "UND" means it is referenced in the current object file but defined elsewhere.

5. "malloc" should appear in the symbol table of the object file of the source code that implements the <stdlib.h> header. It should be defined there as a global ("g") function ("F").

6. The "recur" symbol should appear in the object file where it is defined in, i.e. recurse.obj. It is defined as "00000000 g     F .text  00000052 recur".

7. The symbol "recur" is now defined and placed in the .text section.

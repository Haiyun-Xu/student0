"words" must:
- count the total number of words;
- count the frequency of each word in a file;
- prints the results to stdout;
- multiple file names will be specified as command line arguments;
- if no file is provided, read from stdin;

The word and its frequency will be kept in a struct called "word_count", typedef'ed into type "WordCount", defined in words/word_count.h. The wordcount_sort function is provided in compiled form, and it's linked with the words.o and word_count.o object files. 

The words.o is an ELF formatted binary, and it can only be executed on system that can run ELF executables, such as the the VM, and not on Windows. 

A word is: 1) a sequence of contiguous alphabetical characters; 2) sequence length should be greater than one, and no greater than the maximum length; 3) all words should be converted to to lower-case representation and treated non case-sentively; 4) identical words should be counted each time it appears.

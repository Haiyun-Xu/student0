 * 
 * NOTE: All of the following functions must acquire the lock before any
 * action, and release the lock before returning. Even the edge case check
 * needs to occur after acquiring exclusive usage right (EUR), because if
 * the check passes and only then does the function acquires the lock, it
 * may proceed with the wrong assumption that the shared object is still
 * valid; in our case, the shared object pointed by the argument pointer
 * could well be freed by another thread (when the current thread is
 * interrupted and waiting) and hence not-existent anymore.
 * 
 * This means that we are accessing a pointer without checking if it's valid
 * first, and certainlycan trigger segfault if the argument pointer is NULL.
 * But that's better than mandating that the pointer must be checked again
 * after acquisition of the lock - which is confusing and easy to forget.
 * 
 * NOTE: The functions that directly operate on the shared object, i.e. 
 * acquires/releases the shared object's lock, must not exit early, i.e. 
 * return between the lock acquire/release lines.
 * 
 * That will leave the shared object's ownership in a "claimed" state
 * and cause a deadlock. To prevent a return value discrepancy, we can
 * declare the default return value right after acquiring the lock, and then
 * check for edge cases and allow edge cases to skip the main logic and 
 * immediately return the default return value.
 * 
 * NOTE: Functions that do not directly operate on the shared object DO NOT
 * need to acquire/release the lock on the shared object. This is especially
 * important when a function uses other functions that directly operate on
 * the shared object: if the parent function claimed the lock and becomes
 * blocked before the child function returns, the child function wouldn't be
 * able to acquire the lock and will cause a deadlock.
